## üéØ Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic created an unprecedented humanitarian crisis, leaving millions of people stranded abroad. In response, the Vietnamese government initiated a large-scale repatriation campaign. However, with demand far exceeding the capacity of flights and quarantine facilities, decision-making became incredibly complex.

This project utilizes **Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)** to build a mathematical model that helps policymakers answer the question: *How can we allocate limited resources (aircraft, quarantine beds) to maximize humanitarian value, prioritizing the most vulnerable individuals?*

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture & Tools

The model was built and solved using open-source tools, following this workflow:

| Step | Tool / Library | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Data Loading & Processing** | `Python`, `Pandas` | Read and structure data from an Excel file. |
| **2. Model Formulation** | `PuLP` | Translate mathematical formulas (objective function, constraints) into Python code. |
| **3. Problem Solving** | `CBC Solver (COIN-OR)` | Find the optimal solution for the formulated MILP model. |
| **4. Environment** | `Google Colab` | A cloud-based environment to run the code without complex local setup. |
